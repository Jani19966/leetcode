Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem
Imagine that youâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

A family of related products, say: `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable`.

Several variants of this family. For example, products `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable` are available in these variants: `Modern`, `Victorian`, `ArtDeco`.
